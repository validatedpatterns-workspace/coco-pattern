# RHDP support

Red Hat demo platform is a system for employees and red hat partners to generate test infrastructure.
The scripts in this directory help users of that platform automate deployments.

## To deploy

1. Stand up the 'Azure Subscription Based Blank Open Environment'
2. Download the credentials
3. Load the credentials into your environment (e.g. using `direnv`)
4. Launch the wrapper script from the repository root directory:

### Single Cluster Deployment

   1. `bash ./rhdp/wrapper.sh eastasia`
   2. The wrapper script **requires** an azure region code this code SHOULD be the same as what was selected in RHDP.

### Multi-Cluster Deployment (Hub and Spoke)

   1. `bash ./rhdp/wrapper-multicluster.sh eastasia`
   2. This creates two clusters: `coco-hub` and `coco-spoke` in the same region
   3. The pattern is deployed only on the hub cluster
   4. Hub cluster kubeconfig: `./openshift-install-hub/auth/kubeconfig`
   5. Spoke cluster kubeconfig: `./openshift-install-spoke/auth/kubeconfig`
